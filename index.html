  <h2> Who am I? </h2>
  <p> Welcome to Meg McCann's online profile. Meg is hoping to get a job in Boston, MA following graduation in May 2015. Meg is a marketing and communication studies double major at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia, PA.
  Originally, Meg is a New England girl. Raised in Connecticut and now her family lives full time in Rhode Island.
  Meg is passionate about work that makes a difference and working in a fast paced industry.
  Meg loves working in group settings, bouncing ideas off of one another, as well as thrives under pressure. </p>
<h2> What Makes Meg Unique? </h2>
<p>Meg is a unique candidate through her experience in classes and her internship.
  Meg has created numerous campaigns through class projects, including but not limited to: marketing campaigns, a real life PR Plan, Social Media overhaul for a non-profit organization, and graphic design ad campaign.
  Through my internship at Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation, a non-profit raising funds for pediatric cancer research, I learned much as the fundraising intern over 7 months.
  I worked with Raiser's Edge, promotional materials, events, dance marathon initiative, created certificates of appreciation and research projects.
  I also turned my non-paying internship into a paying internship for the duration I was at Alex's.
